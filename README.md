30 day python challenge for beginners, to help me learn about python. 

(Day 1: introduce myself to the discord.)<br>
(Day 2: download python. I had some trouble, I had to delete and redownload python.) <br>
(Day 3: download VS code.) <br>
(Day 4: Simple print: "Hello, World!". (additionally, added to github)) <br>
(Day 5: added a header, comments, and an introduction sentence to hello_world. Experimented with a string that was too long for one proper line in python: 
  used a backslash to append and used indentation.) <br>
