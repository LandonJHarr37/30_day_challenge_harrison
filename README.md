30 day python challenge for beginners, to help me learn about python. From Oren Cohen (https://thegeekwriter.gumroad.com/l/lzyzw)

(Day 1: introduce myself to the discord.)<br>
(Day 2: download python. I had some trouble, I had to delete and redownload python.) <br>
(Day 3: download VS code.) <br>
(Day 4: Simple print: "Hello, World!". (additionally, added to github)) <br>
(Day 5: added a header, comments, and an introduction sentence to hello_world. Experimented with a string that was too long for one proper line in python: 
  used a backslash to append and used indentation.) <br>
(Day 6: experimented with operators in operators_class.py, simulated a snipbit of a math class) <br>
(Day 7: using variables and experimenting with print formatting)  use of print(f"{}") as opposed to commas seems more efficient when inputing variables <br>
(Day 8: use of if statements in a function definition to complete a simple traffic light scenario) <br>
(Day 9: "Organizing your data", Oren has a lesson on the implementation of Lists and Dictionaries to store data. Learning 
  to understand when to use a list or a dictionary.) <br>
